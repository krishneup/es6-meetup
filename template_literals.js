// template strings in es5


console.log('string text line 1\n' +
'string text line 2');

// how template literals in es6 helps ?

// can write easy multiple strings
console.log(`string text is amazing
yes it is

`);


//can easily write JS  codes too in between with ${}
const location = "Antartica"
console.log(`I am going to ${location}`);
